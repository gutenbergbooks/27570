	<p class="subtitle">EXTRACTS FROM AN ESSAY BY DR. CHARLES DU PREL, IN
	SPHINX, TRANSLATED FOR THE JOURNAL OF MAN.</p>
	<blockquote>
		<p>“<span class="first_word">In</span> the <cite>Wiener Allgemeiner</cite> I spoke of the possibility of moral
		education by means of magnetism, which has been carried out.”&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*</p>

		<p>“Dr. Bernheim, a Professor of the Medical Faculty in Nancy who
		is a champion of hypnotism has written a book on ‘Suggestion and
		its Application in Therapeutics,’ in which a great many hypnotic
		cures are recorded.”</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>“Dr. —— quotes Franklin against magnetism but Sprengel in his
		Pharmacology says ‘Franklin, sickly as he was, took no part whatever
		in the investigation.’ The Academy again investigated
		(1825-31) somnambulism, discovered by Puysegur, Mesmer’s
		scholar. In their report of two year’s investigation, eleven M. D.’s
		unanimously pronounced in favor of all important phenomena
		ascribed to somnambulism. A fairly complete synopsis of their
		report will be found in my ‘Philosophy of Mystics.’”</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>“Du Potet first studied medicine, but disgusted by the poor results
		of Pharmacology he embraced magnetism. He performed a series
		of mesmeric experiments in the Hotel Dieu of so potent a nature
		that twenty M. D.’s of that celebrated hospital signed the minutes of
		these proceedings. People ran after Du Potet, pointing at him and
		crying ‘The man who cures.’”</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>“The respect for medical therapeutics never has been at as low an
		ebb as just now. The public cannot be blamed for this lack of
		respect, for they have daily experiences of the ill results
		of medicine. Even high medical authorities are of the opinion that
		we have to-day a disintegration of medical principles worse than ever.
		More uncertain than therapeutics is the manner of diagnosing to-day!
		The public is well aware that each doctor has something
		different to say or prescribe. I have a personal case in point. During
		eighteen months I consulted seven different doctors, and got seven
		different contrary diagnoses as well as contradictory modes of treatment,
		and this, too, in the city of Munich, which is hardly secondary
		to any other city for its medical talent. Is there any cause to blame
		the public for running to the magnetizers? I should do so myself if
		<a class="pagenum" id="page2" title="2"> </a>my magnetic susceptibility was greater. In such magnetizers as even
		Mesmer, Dr. B. can see nothing but charlatans, but I desire to make
		him aware that a physician whose reputation he is cognizant of, Prof.
		Nussbaum in Munich, said to his audience in College, ‘Gentlemen,
		magnetism is the medicine of the future.’ As I am writing this I
		have been disturbed by a visitor desiring the address of a reliable
		magnetizer, as the physician recommended a magnetizer, as he was at
		his wits end.”</p>

		<p>“In our medicine the adjunct sciences alone are scientific, and we
		must respect their high grade; but therapeutics we have none.
		Hence Mesmer should be called a benefactor to mankind, for he has
		pointed out the correct way. He, with Hippocrates, says that not
		the physician but nature cures—that the real therapeutics consists
		only in aiding the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturæ</em>. In this direction the professors
		at Nancy and Paris are laboring. They have given the experimental
		proof that <em>if the idea of an organic change of the body is
		instilled into the mind of the hypnotized, then such change will take
		place</em>. In this we have a foundation for a <strong class="small_all_caps">PSYCHIC THERAPEUTICS</strong>
		which we hope will soon put an end to the anarchic condition of
		medicine of the present day. But the greatest curse to science of
		old, and which makes its appearance even to-day, is that <em>the old ideas
		are the greatest enemies of the new</em>.”</p>

		<p>“Unfortunately it is the same in the thought realm as in lifeless
		nature, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertiæ</em>—the law of indolence, according to which nature
		remains in its condition to all eternity, until she is forced into
		some new condition from a new cause. This <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis inertiæ</em> is harder
		to conquer in the thought realm than in lifeless nature, for Mesmer
		appeared a hundred years ago, and yet to-day they call him “a perfect
		charlatan.” Braid, thirty years ago, started hypnotism, but only
		after Hansen made a multitude of experiments for profit and pleasure
		in the largest cities of Germany, did the physicians wake up to the
		idea of investigating it. They teach nothing of mesmerism or hypnotism
		at the universities. Yes, even one year ago a professor of
		medicine confessed to me, should I pronounce the word somnambulism
		I’d be ruined. This is the manner in which ideas are
		kept from medical students.”</p>

		<p>“If medicine, in its results, could look with pride on its therapeutics,
		it might be explained. But a therapeutics that allows thousands
		of children to sink yearly into untimely graves from all
		manner of diseases, that allows a large proportion of grown persons
		to be decimated yearly by epidemics, that in its psychiatry is perfectly
		impotent to stop the rapid increase of insanity, that notoriously
		cannot cure a migraine, a cold, yea, not even a corn,—such a
		system ought surely to have some modesty, and be only too glad to
		accept improvements that tend to ameliorate this condition.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h3>CONDITION OF THE MEDICAL PROFESSION.</h3>

	<p>These remarks of Dr. Du Prel, though somewhat exaggerated, are
	probably based on truth in their reference to the backward condition
	of the medical profession in Europe, and of all that portion in
	<a class="pagenum" id="page3" title="3"> </a>America which is essentially European, and governed by European
	authority. But the healing art in America has been to a great
	extent emancipated by the spirit of American liberty, and in its
	actual results among liberal physicians is far in advance of the
	European system. One signal proof of this was given at Cincinnati
	in 1849, when that city was visited by a terrible epidemic of Asiatic
	cholera, which swept off five thousand of its inhabitants. The
	mortality of cholera under old school practise had been from twenty-five
	to sixty per cent., the latter having been realized in hospitals at
	Paris. Under the practice taught in our college at that time, the
	mortality in 1,500 cases did not exceed six per cent.</p>

	<p>The atmosphere of freedom in this country, and the absolute medical
	freedom (until within a few years the colleges have procured medical
	legislation to help their diplomas, and their graduates) have given
	a progressiveness and practicality to American physicians which are
	beginning to be recognized abroad.</p>

	<p>Dr. Lawson Tait is eminent in the treatment of women in England.
	In the <cite>Medical Current</cite> of April 20th, he is quoted as expressing
	a regret that his time and money had not been directed to the
	Western instead of the Eastern Hemisphere, when picking up his
	medical knowledge. He predicted that ‘ere long it will be to the
	medical colleges of America rather than to those of Europe that
	students will travel.’ Then he goes on to say:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“American visitors abroad who have given weeks and months to
		see me work, have one and all impressed me with their possession of
		that feature of mind which in England I fear we do not possess, the
		power of judging any question solely upon its merits, and entirely
		apart from any prejudice, tradition, or personal bias. No matter how
		we may struggle against it, tradition rules all we do; we cannot
		throw off its shackles, and I am bound to plead guilty to this weakness
		myself, perhaps as fully as any of my countrymen may be compelled
		to do. I may have thrown off the shackles in some instances,
		but I know that I am firmly bound in others, and my hope is that my
		visit to a freer country and a better climate may extend my mental
		vision.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h3>POWER OF MAGNETISM AND SUGGESTION.</h3>

	<p>The suggestion of Du Prel as to the hypnotic teaching in France,
	that an idea impressed on the mind of the hypnotized will be realized
	in the body is the basis of a great deal of therapeutic philosophy. It
	is true in practice just to the extent of human impressibility. A
	cheerful physician or friend, by encouraging words impresses the idea
	of recovery and thus sometimes produces it. Judicious friends never
	speak in a discouraging manner to the invalid. The success of mind
	cure practitioners is based on this principle. They endeavor to impress
	on the patient’s mind the idea of perfect health, but they know
	too little of the whole subject to know how to place the patient
	in that passive and receptive condition in which the results are
	most promptly and certainly produced.</p>

	<p>Such methods are limited in their effect in proportion to human
	impressibility and cannot possibly supersede all use of remedies which
	<a class="pagenum" id="page4" title="4"> </a>reach thousands of cases in which mental operations would be entirely
	futile. But the power of animal magnetism over all diseases and
	infirmities of mind and body has been so often demonstrated that its
	neglect is a deep disgrace to the medical colleges. A correspondent
	of the <cite>Daily Telegraph</cite> gives the following illustration of its power
	over drunkenness:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“About eighteen months ago I was conversing with my friend B.,
		who is an enthusiastic believer in mesmerism, and has repute as an
		amateur practitioner. My contention was that his favorite
		science (?) had contributed absolutely nothing to the world’s good to
		cause its recognition by either scientists or philosophers. ‘Can you
		give me,’ said I, ‘one instance in which you have conferred an
		actual benefit by the practice of your favorite art?’ He related
		several, from which I selected the following:—‘There lives by my
		parsonage,’ said my friend B., ‘a man who for many years, had
		been a confirmed drunkard. Repeatedly were his wife and children
		forced to flee from him, for when in his drunken frenzies, he
		attempted to murder them. Again and again have I striven to induce
		him to flee from his horrible vice, but my efforts were always
		futile. One day he called to see me when he was suffering acutely
		from the effects of drink. I resolved to place him under mesmeric
		influence. This I did, and while subject to me made him promise
		not to touch strong drink again, and if he attempted to break his
		pledge, might the drink taste to him filthy as putrid soapsuds. I
		then restored him to his normal state, and he left me. He kept his
		unconsciously given promise. In the course of a couple of years
		this man raised himself from a condition of poverty to the comfortable
		position of a thriving market gardener. ‘Not a fortnight
		since,’ resumed my friend, ‘my neighbor’s wife laughingly said to
		me, ‘There is no fear of my husband ever drinking again, sir. You
		know he has to be in the market very early in the morning with his
		vegetables. Yesterday morning, while he was drinking a cup of
		coffee at the hotel an old mate said to him, ‘Why don’t you drink
		some spirits; are you afraid?’ To show his mate that he was not
		afraid, he ordered a glass of brandy, but no sooner did he put it in
		his mouth than he spat it out again, saying the ‘filthy stuff tasted
		like rotten soapsuds.’ My friend B. said, that, till he told me, to
		no one had he mentioned the fact, and that what he did to his poor
		neighbor he did in order to see if it were possible to use mesmerism
		as a remedial agent in cases of drunkenness.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>The power of control over the impressible condition (which is so
	easily developed into hypnotism) has been recently illustrated in
	France, and reports of the phenomena published in the <cite>London News</cite>,
	concerning which Mr. Charles Dawbarn has published the following
	in the <cite>Banner of Light</cite>:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“According to the reports published in the <cite>Daily News</cite> of London,
		Eng., an attempt has been made by physicians in Paris, France, to
		determine the duration of an hypnotic influence. Some of my readers
		may not be aware that ‘hypnotism’ is a word coined by the
		medical faculty to replace the term ‘mesmerism,’ which they consider
		<a class="pagenum" id="page5" title="5"> </a>disreputably associated with spiritualism. These physicians
		seem to have had some very fine sensitives upon whom to operate.
		The first experiment was upon a lady of some means, but having a
		mother and sister dependent upon her for support. The hypnotizer
		first established his influence in the usual manner, and then told the
		lady he wished her to go to a lawyer the next day, and make her will
		in his favor. She protested, but finally gave way. All memory of
		this promise seemed to be lost as soon as she returned to her normal
		condition. But next day she went to a lawyer, and although he
		begged her to remember her mother and sister, the will was made
		just as suggested by the physician. She was an affectionate daughter
		and told the lawyer she was impelled to leave her property to a
		stranger by <em>an influence which she could not resist</em>.</p>

		<p>“A second experiment with another sensitive was then tried. This
		time the poor girl promised to poison a friend next day, she carried
		away with her a dose prepared by the doctor. Not knowing why,
		and like the other sensitive, <em>under an influence she could not resist</em>,
		she gave her friend the harmless drug in a glass of milk, and thus
		enacted the part of a murderer.</p>

		<p>“These experiments have the novelty of having been made by the
		regular faculty; but thousands of Spiritualists have proved the truth
		of an hypnotic influence lasting long after the apparent release of the
		sensitive. We know, or ought to know, that the hypnotic condition
		can be induced without visible passes; and many of us have seen a
		sensitive under influence sitting quietly, showing no sign of her
		slavery to the will of another. We may go yet a step further and
		assert that men and women, visible and invisible, are constantly psychologizing
		each other, although we only use the term “sensitive”
		when the effect is visible to our dull senses.</p>

		<p>“But Spiritualists as a whole have been converted by the phenomena
		appealing to their outward senses, and know little and care little
		for effects that can only be traced by shrewd, careful and scientific
		experiment. Yet such facts as come to the surface in those experiments
		with sensitives in France, are keys with which to unlock some
		of life’s darkest mysteries, and expose the harsh treatment of many
		mediums.</p>

		<p>“Many of us have been greatly troubled by the conduct of our
		mediums, and often puzzled by their careful prepared attempts at
		fraud. Mediums we have met and loved, because they have given
		us proof after proof of the ‘gates ajar’ for angel visitors, have been
		presently detected in frauds that required days of careful preparation.
		We have cried, ‘Down with the frauds!’ and insisted that they
		should return to wash-tub and spade for an honest living.</p>

		<p>“We have omitted to keep in view that one who is a medium Mondays,
		Wednesdays and Fridays must also be a medium Tuesdays,
		Thursdays and Saturdays, and we have neglected to learn the lessons
		of our own experience. I was talking recently to a gentleman of
		prominence, twice sheriff of his county, who was narrating with glee
		how he had mesmerised a young man, and then told him, ‘At noon
		to-morrow you will be lame, and it will last two hours.’ Of course it
		<a class="pagenum" id="page6" title="6"> </a>happened much to the poor fellows perplexity, but my friend would
		have been surprised to discover that therein was the entire case of
		the French sensitives and of our poor mediums.</p>

		<p>“A very important thought is that an hypnotic influence need not
		spring from any verbal expression. We all carry with us an
		influence which strikes every sensitive we meet; and if we sit with
		her when she is, of course, specially passive, she must receive a yet
		more marked influence. There is a photographic curiosity now often
		exhibited which, I think, illustrates the thought I want to emphasize.
		A family or a class can be photographed, one by one, at exactly the
		same focus and on the same negative, with a result that you have a
		clear and distinct face, not of any one’s personality, but that actually
		combines the features of the whole into a new individual unlike any
		of the sitters.”</p>

		<p>“This is the very influence we cast upon a sensitive when she sits
		for us in a miscellaneous circle. We cannot say that any one of us
		has powerfully affected her, but we know the entire influence has got
		control and possession, and that influence follows her, too often with
		irresistible power.”</p>

	<p>The publication of a work on animal magnetism by Binet and
	Féré of Paris prompts the following sketch of the subject by the
	<cite>Boston Herald</cite>, a newspaper which pays great attention to anything
	foreign or anything from the old school profession, but ignores that
	which is American and original. The reader will observe that
	the writers are all in the dark, unable to explain the phenomena
	they describe.</p>

	<h3>PROGRESS OF MAGNETISM.</h3>

	<p>One of the most notable features of the scientific tendencies of the
	present day is the extraordinary interest taken in the investigation of
	those peculiar physical and psychical conditions attending the states
	now known collectively under the name of hypnotism, varying from
	lethargy, catalepsy, etc., to somnambulism. Until quite recently these
	investigations have been frowned upon and tabooed in scientific
	circles, and the fact that any man of scientific inclinations was
	known to feel an interest in matters associated with “mesmerism”
	or “animal magnetism” was sufficient to make him an object of suspicion,
	and injure his good standing amongst his fellow-scientists.
	The result of the so-called investigations long ago instituted by the
	French Academy, pronouncing in effect the whole subject a humbug
	and delusion, has lain like an interdict upon further researches, and
	the whole matter was left over, for the most part, to charlatans or to
	persons hardly capable of forming sound judgments or proceeding
	according to the accurate methods demanded by modern
	science. Science, however, in the remarkable progress attained of
	late, has advanced so far upon certain lines that it has been hardly
	possible to proceed further in those directions without entering upon
	the forbidden field. Therefore, the old signboards against trespassing
	have been taken down. For “mesmerism,” that verbal scarecrow,
	has been substituted “hypnotism,” which word has had a wonderfully
	<a class="pagenum" id="page7" title="7"> </a>legitimatizing effect; while “animal magnetism,” that once
	flouted idea, has been proven to be an existent fact by methods as
	accurate as those adopted by Faraday or Edison to verify their observations.</p>

	<h3>EFFORTS OF SCIENTISTS.</h3>

	<p>Many of the most eminent scientists of Europe are now devoting
	themselves assiduously to these researches. Periodicals making a
	specialty of the subject are now published in France, Germany, and
	England. A catalogue of the recent literature of hypnotism and related
	phenomena, compiled by Max Dessoir, was printed in the number
	of the German magazine called the <cite>Sphinx</cite> for February of
	this year, and this catalogue occupied nine pages. The list is limited
	to those works written on the lines laid under the methods of the
	modern school, all books being excluded whose authors hold to
	“mesmeric” theories, or who are even professional magnetizers. The
	catalogue is, therefore, as strictly scientific as possible, and, being
	classified with German thoroughness under the different branches of
	the subject, such as “hystero-hypnotism,” “suggestion,” “fascination,”
	etc., it will prove a valuable assistance to the student.</p>

	<p>In this country the interest of scientists has not yet been aroused
	to an extent comparable with that of European investigators. Old
	prejudices have not entirely lost their potency. One of the most
	eminent professors of a leading university is said to have been subjected
	to ridicule from his colleagues because of a marked interest
	shown in the subject, and a Boston physician of high standing
	within a few months confided to the writer that he had made use of
	hypnotic methods, with gratifying success, in the case of a patient
	where ordinary remedies had proven unavailing, but he did not venture
	to make the results public, since his fellow doctors might be inclined
	to condemn his action as “irregular.”</p>

	<p>A work embracing the whole subject has lately appeared in Paris,
	and, as it is to form a volume of the valuable International Scientific
	series, published in English, French, German, and Italian, it can
	hardly fail to diffuse a correct popular understanding of the results
	thus far attained. The book is called “Le Magnetism Animal”
	(Animal Magnetism), and its authors are Messrs. Alfred Binet and
	Charles Féré of the medical staff of the Salpètrière Hospital for
	Nervous Disorders in Paris. It gives a history of the patient researches
	conducted at that institution by the medical staff under the
	celebrated Prof. Charcot during the past nine years. These experiments
	have been prosecuted according to the most exact scientific
	methods, and with the most extreme caution. The endeavor has
	been to obtain, first of all, the most elementary psychic phenomena,
	and to test every step in the investigations by separate experiment,
	specially devised to prove the good faith of the subject and the reality
	of his hallucination, to eliminate the possibility of unconscious
	suggestion, to establish relations with similar phenomena of disease
	or health in the domain of physiology and psychology, and to note
	the modifications which can be brought about by altering the conditions
	of the experiments. The authors possess the great scientific
	<a class="pagenum" id="page8" title="8"> </a>virtue of never dogmatising. In the entire book not a single law is
	laid down, not a single hypothesis is advanced, which is not reached
	by the most approved inductive processes. A great service of the
	book lies in its enunciation of new and trustworthy methods for
	studying the physiology of the brain in health and disease, while it
	brings into the realm of physical experiment vexed questions of
	psychology heretofore given over to metaphysical methods exclusively.</p>

	<h3>THE HYPNOTIC SLEEP</h3>

	<p>Is described as a different form of natural sleep, and all the causes
	which bring on fatigue are capable of bringing on hypnotism in
	suitable subjects. Two of the leading hypnotic states are lethargy
	and catalepsy, the former being analogous to deep sleep, and the
	latter to a light slumber. In lethargy the respiratory movements are
	slow and deep; in catalepsy slight, shallow, very slow, and separated
	by a long interval. In lethargy the application of a magnet over
	the region of the stomach causes profound modifications in the
	breathing and circulation, while there is no such effect in catalepsy.
	This shows the connection of hypnotism with magnetism, and various
	other experiments with magnets have produced some remarkable
	results. Here it may be added that Dr. Gessmann, a Vienna scientist
	who has made a specialty of hypnotic studies, has invented and
	successfully applied an instrument called a hypnoscope, consisting of
	an arrangement of magnets for the purpose of ascertaining whether
	any person is a good hypnotic subject.</p>

	<p>The experiments demonstrate that sensation in the hypnotic states
	varies between the two opposite poles of hyperæsthesia and anæesthesia;
	in other words, the senses may be extraordinarily exalted, as in
	somnambulism, or, as in lethargy, they may be extinct, except sometimes
	hearing. In somnambulism the field of vision and acuteness
	of sight are about doubled, hearing is made very acute, and smell is
	so intensely developed that a subject can find by scent the fragment
	of a card, previously given him to feel, and then torn up and hidden.
	The memory in somnambulism is similarly exalted. When awakened
	the subject does not, as a rule, remember anything that occurred
	while he was entranced, but, when again hypnotized, his memory
	includes all the facts of his sleep, his life when awake and his former
	sleeps. Richet attests how somnambules recall with a luxury of
	detail scenes in which they have taken part and places they have
	visited long ago. M——, one of his somnambules, sings the air of the
	second act of the opera “L’Africaine” when she is asleep, but can
	not remember a note of it when awake.</p>

	<p>There is a theory that no experience whatever of any person is
	lost to the memory; it is only the power to recall it that is defective.
	The authors of this work say that, while the exaltation of the
	memory during somnambulism does not give absolute proof to the
	theory that nothing is lost, it proves at any rate that the memory of
	preservation is much greater than is generally imagined, in comparison
	with the memory of reproduction, or recollection. “It is evident,”
	they say, “that in a great number of cases, where we believe
	<a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9"> </a>the memory is completely blotted out, it is nothing of the kind.
	The trace is always there, but what is lacking is the power to evoke
	it; and it is highly probable that if we were subjected to hypnotism,
	or the action of suitable excitants, memories to all appearance dead
	might be revived.”</p>

	<p>A comparison between the phenomena of awakening from natural
	and artificial sleep is instituted. In the case of dreams, recollection
	more or less vivid persists for a few seconds, then becomes effaced.
	This forgetfulness is even more marked in the case of hypnosis. On
	returning to natural consciousness, the subject cannot recompose a
	single one of the scenes in which he has played his part as witness
	or actor. The loss, however, is not complete, for often a word or
	two is sufficient to bring back a whole scene, though this word or
	two coming from operator to subject, partakes more or less of the
	nature of a suggestion.</p>

	<h3>SUGGESTION.</h3>

	<p>“Suggestion,” by which is meant the production of thoughts and
	actions on the part of the subject through some indication or hint
	given by the operator, is found to be analogous to dreaming. Say
	the authors: “For suggestion to succeed, the subject must have
	naturally fallen, or been artificially thrown into a state of morbid
	receptivity: but it is difficult to determine accurately the conditions
	of suggestionability. However, we may mention two. The first,
	the mental inertia of the subject:&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* the consciousness is
	completely empty: an idea is suggested, and reigns supreme over
	the slumbering consciousness,&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* The second is psychic
	hyperexcitability, the cause of the aptitude for suggestion.” “For
	example, we say to a patient: ‘Look, you have a bird in your apron,’
	and no sooner are these simple words pronounced than she sees the
	bird, feels it with her fingers, and sometimes even hears it sing.”
	“Again, in place of speech we engage the attention of the patient,
	and when her gaze has become settled and obediently follows all our
	movements, we imitate with the hand the motion of an object which
	flies. Soon the subject cries: ‘Oh, what a pretty bird!’ How has a
	simple gesture produced so singular an effect?”</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“It is admitted, however, that the hypothesis of the association
		of ideas only partly covers the facts of suggestion, even when
		stretched to include resemblances. For instance, when we
		charge the brain of an entranced patient with some strange idea,
		such as, ‘On awakening you will rob Mr. So-and-so of his handkerchief,’
		and on awakening, the patient accomplishes the theft commanded,
		can we believe that in such a sequence there is nothing
		more than an image associated with an act? In point of fact, the
		patient has appropriated and assimilated the idea of the experimenter.
		She does not passively execute a strange order, but the order
		has passed in her consciousness from passive to active. We can go
		so far as to say that the patient has the will to steal. This state is
		complex and obscure, hitherto no one has explained it.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*
		The facts of paralysis by suggestion completely upset classical
		psychology.  The experimenter who produces them so easily
		<a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10"> </a>knows neither what he produces nor how he does it. Take
		the example of a systematic anæsthesia (paralysis of sensation).
		We say to the subject, ‘On awakening you will not see Mr. X., who
		is there before us; he will have completely disappeared.’ No
		sooner said than done; the patient on awakening sees every one
		around her except Mr. X. When he speaks she does not answer
		his questions; if he places his hand on her shoulder she does not
		feel the contact; if he gets in her way, she walks straight on, and is
		terrified at being stopped by an invisible obstacle.&nbsp;*&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Here
		the laws of association, which do such good service in solving
		psychological problems, abandon us completely. Apparently they
		do not account for all the facts of consciousness.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<h3>PORTRAITS BY HALLUCINATION.</h3>

	<p>A remarkable and suggestive series of experiments performed
	with portraits by hallucination is given in the book. These experiments
	show, that if by suggestion a subject is made to see a portrait
	on a sheet of card board which is exactly alike on both sides, the
	image will always be seen on the same side, and, however it is presented,
	the subject will always place the card with the surfaces and
	edges in the exact positions they occupied at the moment of suggestion,
	in such a manner that the image can neither be reversed nor
	inclined. If the surfaces are reversed, the image is no longer seen;
	if the edges, it is seen upside down. The subject is never caught
	in a mistake; the changes may be made out of his sight, but the
	image is invariably seen in accordance with the primitive conditions,
	although absolutely no difference is to be detected by the
	normal vision between the two blank surfaces.</p>

	<p>One experiment brings out this fact clearly. On a white sheet of
	paper is placed a card equally white; with a fine point, but without
	touching the paper, the contour of the card is followed while the
	idea of a line traced in black is suggested to the subject. The subject,
	when awakened, is asked to fold the paper according to these
	imaginary lines. He holds the paper at the distance at which it was
	at the moment of suggestion, and folds it in the form of a rectangle
	exactly superposable on the card.</p>

	<p>A curious experiment in the same line has been often repeated by
	Prof. Charcot. The subject is given the suggestion of a portrait on
	a white card, which is then shuffled up with a dozen cards all alike.
	On awakening, the subject is asked to run over the collection, without
	being told the reason why it is wished. When he comes to the card
	on which had been located the imaginary portrait, he at once perceives
	it. One detail of these experiments is very significant. Supposing
	we show the imaginary portrait at a distance of two yards
	from the subject’s eyes, the card appears white, whereas a real photograph
	would appear gray. If it is gradually brought nearer, the
	imaginary portrait at last appears, but it is necessary for it to be
	much nearer than an ordinary photograph for the patient to recognize
	the subject. By means of opera glasses we can make the
	patient recognize her hallucination at a distance at which she could
	<a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11"> </a>not perceive it with the naked eye. In short, the imaginary object
	which figures in the hallucination is perceived under the same conditions
	as if it were real. Various other experiments are detailed in
	support of this formula. The opera glasses only act as if they were
	focussed upon the point of hallucination, and in the case of a short-sighted
	subject they had to be altered to allow for the defect of vision.
	If the patient looks through a prism the image is seen duplicated, although
	the subject is absolutely ignorant of the properties of a prism,
	as well as of the fact that the glass is a prism. A photograph of the
	plain white card used when the photograph was suggested may be
	substituted, and on being shown to the patient, the hallucinatory
	image is seen just the same, even two years after the original
	experiment, as was done in one case.</p>

	<p>Some strange phenomena of polarity are related. The following
	experiments by MM. Binet and Féré are given in illustration: “We
	give a patient in somnambulism the common hallucination of a bird
	poised on her finger. While she is caressing the imaginary bird she
	is awakened and a magnet is brought near her head. After a few
	minutes she stops short, raises her eyes and looks about in astonishment.
	The bird which was on her finger has disappeared. She looks
	all over the ward and at last finds it, for we hear her say, ‘So you
	thought you would leave me, little bird.’ After a few minutes the
	bird again disappears anew, but almost immediately reappears. The
	patient complains from time to time of a pain in the head at a point
	corresponding to what has been described in this book as the visual
	centre (some distance above and slightly posterior to the ear).” The
	magnet also has the same effect in suspending the real perception.
	One of the patients was shown a Chinese gong and striker, and took
	fright on sight of the instrument. When a blow was struck she instantly
	fell into catalepsy. She was reawakened, and asked to look
	attentively at the gong; meanwhile, without her knowledge, a small
	magnet was brought near her head. After a minute the instrument
	had completely disappeared from her sight. When it was struck with
	redoubled force, she only looked from side to side with an air of
	slight astonishment.</p>

	<hr class="short" />

	<p>The mysteries which puzzle these writers are made plain by anthropology,
	and I have been presenting the explanation for over forty
	years to my pupils. The sensibility to hypnotic phenomena is due to
	the anterior portion of the middle lobe of the brain—to the portion
	which is developed one inch behind the external angle of the eye,
	by exciting which we bring on the somnolent condition. The predominance
	of this region renders the person liable to the mesmeric
	phenomena.</p>

	<p>The hypnoscope proposed is quite unnecessary. The proper test of
	magnetic susceptibility is either to excite the organ of somnolence
	and observe if the eyes are disposed to close, or to pass your fingers
	over the outstretched hand of the subject, within one or two inches,
	and observe if he feels any impression. A distinct feeling of coolness
	is sufficient proof of magnetic susceptibility.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12"> </a>Let those who wish to investigate the subject begin in accordance
	with true science by testing the sensitiveness of the hand. If
	sensitive, let the subject sit in a passive state, while you touch the
	somnolent region on the temples, one inch horizontally behind the
	brow. In from one to ten minutes the eyes will show a disposition
	to close, winking repeatedly until a dreamy condition arises, with
	a tendency to a conscious sleep. In this condition the susceptibility
	is extreme. Experiments in psychometry may be tried with success;
	the organs of the brain may be excited, and many interesting experiments
	may be made by those who understand the brain, for intellectual
	purposes, or for the promotion of health and cure of diseases.</p>

	<p>The whole subject is thoroughly explained in the College of
	Therapeutics, making thereby a perfect guidance to health, and to
	progress in philosophy, and supplying the great lack in all systems
	of education—self-knowledge and the sublime art of health,
	longevity, and progress in Divine wisdom.</p>

	<h2 class="title">The So-Called Scientific Immortality.</h2>


	<p>The Smithsonian Institution at Washington was founded for the
	increase and diffusion of knowledge. Guided by the contracted
	notions prevalent among scientists, it has not accomplished much for
	either object. The theory of Lester F. Ward of this institution was
	paraphrased as follows in the last <cite class="name">Journal</cite>:</p>

	<div class="poem">
		<p>As for immortal life I must confess,</p>
		<p>Science has never, never answered “yes.”</p>
		<p>Indeed all psycho-physiological sciences show,</p>
		<p>If we’d be loyal, we must answer “no!”</p>
		<p>Man cannot recollect before being born,</p>
		<p>And hence his future life must be “in a horn.”</p>
		<p>There must be a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">parte ante</em> if there’s a <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">parte post</em>,</p>
		<p>And logic thus demolishes every future ghost.</p>
		<p>Upon this subject the voice of science</p>
		<p>Has ne’er been aught but stern defiance.</p>
		<p>Mythology and magic belong to “<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">limbus fatuorum</em>;”</p>
		<p>If fools believe them, we scientists deplore ’em.</p>
		<p>But, nevertheless, the immortal can’t be lost,</p>
		<p>For every atom has its bright, eternal ghost!</p>
	</div>

	<p>Mr. Ward appears to enjoy greatly this theory of his own final
	extinction, and he exclaims with infinite self-satisfaction, “this
	pure and ennobling sense of truth he would scorn to barter for the
	selfish and illusory hope of an eternity of personal existence.” This
	is quite a jolly funeral indeed!</p>

	<p>It is true Mr. Ward’s very profound theories contradict an immense
	number of facts observed by wiser men than himself, but so
	much the worse for the facts,—they must not embarrass a Smithsonian
	philosopher when he solves to his own satisfaction the vast
	problem of the universe. This Mr. Ward thinks he has done. It is
	quite an ingenious and laboriously constructed hypothesis, but like
	all other attempts to construct a grand philosophy without a basis
	<a class="pagenum" id="page13" title="13"> </a>of fact, it is hard to manufacture the theory and hard to comprehend
	it. Mr. Ward says himself in the <cite>Open Court</cite> that even to
	comprehend his doctrine would require the “careful reading of
	nearly 200 pages,” while “to see the matter in precisely the same
	light as I see it would require the reading of the entire work of some
	1400 pages!” Really, Mr. Ward, the writer who cannot sufficiently
	befuddle himself and his readers in fifty pages is not very skilful.</p>

	<p>Nevertheless the Ward theory is one of the best that has ever been
	gotten up by the champions of nescience, and is worthy of a statement
	in the Journal as quite an improvement on the common expression
	of materialistic stolidity. He claims that he does not deny immortality,
	but he recognizes no immortality of man—no human soul.
	He recognizes only the immortality of the world, such as it is, which
	nobody denies. The future life of man he considers nothing but an
	illusion, though there is an immortality of intelligence <em>here</em> in successive
	forms.</p>

	<p>The doctrine, is that spirit, intelligence, or consciousness is a
	part of matter—that every atom has its own little share, which practically
	amounts to nothing in its infinite subdivision, but when matter
	comes into organized forms the spiritual powers thus aggregated and
	organized become an efficient spiritual energy; and the higher the
	organism the grander the power that is developed, man being the
	most perfect organization evolves the grandest spiritual power, as a
	superior violin evolves finer music than a tambourine. But the intelligence
	and will of man are only phenomena, like the music, and
	have no existence beyond that of the organism that produces them.
	This is substantially the theory of materialists generally, and of the
	old school medical colleges which consider human life a mere product
	of human tissues in combination—a doctrine conclusively refuted in
	“Therapeutic Sarcognomy.”</p>

	<p>The special merit of the Ward theory lies in the supposition that
	mind and matter are elements everywhere inseparably united, and
	that human intelligence is developed by the aggregation and organization
	of the mind powers that reside in the atoms of matter,—an
	explanation which does not often occur to the exponents of
	materialism,—and has the merit of ingenuity. The theory would
	do very well if it were not demonstrable that life exists only from
	influx, and that human life and personality survive the body, and
	become known to every highly organized sensitive, who knows how
	to investigate such matters.</p>

	<p>The Ward theory demolishes the Deity with the greatest ease, and
	places man, fleeting or evanescent as he is, at the summit of the
	universe! As he expresses it, “The only intelligence in the
	universe worthy of the name is the intelligence of the organized
	beings which have been evolved; and the highest manifestations of
	the psychic power known to the occupants of this planet is that
	which emanates from the human brain. Thus does science invert
	the pantheistic pyramid.”</p>

	<p>Such is the fog that emanates from the institution that should
	help the advance and diffusion of knowledge. No God! no soul!
	<a class="pagenum" id="page14" title="14"> </a>not even the awful power that Spencer blindly acknowledges—nothing
	but matter bubbling up and organizing itself into temporary
	forms that decay and are gone forever. We may well reciprocate
	his suggestion, and say that such doctrines belong to the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">limbus
	fatuorum</em>, and, if enjoyed as Mr. Ward enjoys them, they may well
	be called the “fool’s paradise.” I think Hegel has some similar
	notion—that God becomes conscious only in man, unconscious
	everywhere else! And even so brilliant a writer as M. Renan
	says, “For myself I think that there is not in the universe any
	intelligence superior to that of man.” In reading such expressions
	we are strongly reminded of the poem on the “rationalistic chicken,”
	which would not admit that it ever came out of an egg. When the
	wisdom shown in the universe is so immensely beyond the comprehension
	of man, how can he assume his own to be the highest wisdom?</p>

	<p>To such dreary absurdities as this the <cite>Open Court</cite> newspaper at
	Chicago is devoted, and it has a bevy of well-educated friends and
	supporters—well-educated as the world goes,—and graced with
	literary capacity and culture, but educated into blindness and
	ignorance of the scientific phenomena of psychic science,—unwilling
	to investigate or incapable of candid investigation. The coterie
	sustaining such a newspaper are precisely in the position of the
	contemporaries of Galileo, who refused to look through his telescope
	or study his demonstrations.</p>

	<p>It is not from any scientific spirit or scientific acumen that this
	materialistic coterie avoid psychometric and spiritual facts. The
	newspapers which ignore or sneer at such knowledge are easily
	gulled in matters of science. A writer in the <cite>Open Court</cite> upon the
	possibilities of the future, which he presents as being confined
	“strictly to legitimate deductions from present knowledge,” exhibits
	an amount and variety of ignorant credulity which ought not to
	have gained admission to an intelligent journal. He speaks of an
	unlimited freedom of submarine navigation and navigation of the
	air which would not have appeared possible to any but the most
	superficial sciolist. He also speaks of an electroscope that will telegraph
	rays of light (!) and enable us thereby to see our most distant
	friends, and of stowing in a small compass electricity enough
	to exterminate an army. This imaginative ignoramus adds, “Give
	to our present biped acquaintance the ability to exterminate armies
	with a lightning flash, added to the power of sailing at will through
	the air or of passing at will and in safety beneath the ocean waves,
	and he would depopulate the earth.” The writer gives much more
	of this Munchausen stuff which is not worthy of notice except as
	an illustration of the feeble scientific intelligence with which many
	newspapers are edited. The editor of a really scientific journal
	referred to this article in the <cite>Open Court</cite> “as a proof of the danger
	of a little knowledge.”<a href="#footnote_1" id="fnm1" title="The air is certainly..." class="fnmarker">1</a></p>

	<h2 class="title"><a class="pagenum" id="page15" title="15"> </a>Review of the New Education.</h2>

	<p class="author">BY SAMUEL EADON, M.A., M.D., PH.D., F.S.A., ETC.</p>

	<p>I have read very carefully the third edition of the “New Education,”
	and feel impelled, in order to satisfy my conscientiousness, to
	write a short article relative to the impressions which the reading of
	the book produced in my mind.</p>

	<p>It is a work of extraordinary merit. Like George Combe’s “Constitution
	of Man,” it is highly suggestive; the fascination of the
	author was such that I could not help but write. To know its value
	and appreciate its lofty moral outpourings, people must buy the book
	and read for themselves. The first thought would be that it is the
	production of an original thinker who had the courage to utter
	opinions fearless of results, however antagonistic to the common-herd
	notions.</p>

	<p>In all ages, the human understanding, the reasoning faculties,
	have ever been considered to hold the supremacy in the scale of
	development, of culture, and of advance toward a higher form of
	civilization; the moral faculties were thought next in order, and
	then the propensities common to all animal natures held the third
	or inferior position. This view of human nature has been handed
	down from an elder antiquity and still retains its hold largely in the
	universities and great public schools of the present day.</p>

	<p>If this view of the nature of man be a correct one, there ought to
	be a vast intellectual brotherhood of mankind; but it is not so.
	From the days of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, this culture of the
	intellectual power has been continuously pursued, but with very
	slender results; for were this kind of education pursued for 100,000
	years, the morale of society would be little better than it is at the
	present time.</p>

	<p>Dr. Buchanan takes quite a different view and makes the moral
	or ethical faculties supreme, in development and culture, the intellect
	being the instruments for acquiring facts and the propensities
	the steam to bring about the desired results. According to his
	views of man, our emotional faculties are of a higher or more God-like
	order than our intellectual powers. The intellect being the
	hand-maid to the emotions, to <em>feel</em> the force of truth is higher in mental
	excellence than to <em>perceive</em> it. Depth of emotions is the climax
	of spiritual power.</p>

	<p>The ethical and æsthetic being the foundation of the New Education,
	Dr. Buchanan, in a series of beautifully written chapters, enters
	into details in reference to what teachers should be, what the subjects
	taught ought to be, and what are the shells and what the kernels of
	knowledge. He shows clearly that woman will ultimately be the
	regenerator of humanity, that education so far has been merely fractional
	and one-sided—that true development consists in the co-education
	of soul and body, the co-education of man and woman, the
	co-education of the material and spiritual worlds.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16"> </a>There are a million of teachers, and every one should have a copy
	of this work. No man is fit to teach in the high sense advocated by
	this author unless he has thoroughly mastered this work. It is easy
	to pull down a system, but not so easy to build it up; but in the
	New Education the follies of the old educational systems are not
	only levelled to the dust, but a higher and more practical, industrious,
	and crime-preventing system of training and teaching takes
	its place. This book will become the grand educational Bible for
	teachers in all countries where the English language is spoken.</p>

	<p>Nor should it be in the hands of teachers only. Every intelligent
	father and mother, anxious for the development of their sons and
	daughters should study this book night and day. It should be
	translated into every European language, and also into Chinese and
	other Eastern tongues; the refined, æsthetic, and knowledge-loving
	people of Japan, were the work translated into their language, would
	enjoy it intensely.</p>

		“New Education” in Japan. The <cite class="name">Journal</cite> has not room at present

<div id="art4" class="article">
	<h2 class="title">Victoria’s Half Century</h2>

	<p>We are nearing the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning
	of Queen Victoria’s reign. A London writer, reviewing the
	changes which have taken place in the period marks these notable
	points: A strange country was England in those far-off days; there
	was but little difference between the general state of society under
	William and the general state of society under George II. If we
	compared the courts of George IV. and William with the company
	of a low tap-room, we should not flatter the tap-room. Broad-blown
	coarseness, rank debauchery, reckless prodigality, were seen
	at their worst in the abode of English monarchs. A decent woman
	was out of place amid the stupid horrors of the Pavilion or of Windsor;
	and we do not wonder at the sedulous care which the Queen’s
	guardians employed to keep her beyond reach of the prevailing corruption.
	A man like the Duke of Cumberland would not now be
	permitted to show his face in public save in the dock; but in those
	times his peculiar habits were regarded as quite royal and quite natural.
	Jockeys, blacklegs, gamblers, prize-fighters were esteemed as
	the natural companions of princes; and when England’s king drove
	up to the verge of a prize-ring in the company of a burly rough who
	was about to exchange buffets with another rough, the proceeding
	was considered as quite manly and orthodox. Imagine the Prince of
	Wales driving in the park with a champion boxer!</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17"> </a>A strange country indeed was England in those times; and to look
	through the newspapers and memoirs of fifty years ago is an amusement
	at once instructive and humiliating. The king dines with the
	premier duke, makes him drunk, and has him carefully driven round
	the streets, so that the public may see what an intoxicated nobleman
	is like. The same king pushes a statesman into a pond, and screams
	with laughter as the drenched victim crawls out. Morning after
	morning the chief man of the realm visits the boxing-saloon, and
	learns to batter the faces and ribs of other noble gentlemen. We
	hear of visits paid by royalty to an obscure Holborn tavern, where,
	after noisy suppers, the fighting-men were wont to roar their hurricane
	choruses and talk with many blasphemies of by-gone combats. Think
	of that succession of ugly and foul sports compared with the peace,
	the refinement, the gentle and subdued manners of Victoria’s court,
	and we see how far England has travelled since 1837.</p>

	<p>Fifty years ago our myriads of kinsmen across the seas were
	strangers to us, and the amazing friendship which has sprung up between
	the subjects of Victoria and the citizens of the vast republic
	was represented fifty years ago by a kind of sheepish, good-humored
	ignorance, tempered by jealousy. The smart packets left London
	and Liverpool to thrash their way across the Atlantic swell, and they
	were lucky if they managed to complete the voyage in a month—Charles
	Dickens sailed in a vessel which took twenty-two days for
	the trip, and she was a steamer, no less! For all practical purposes
	England and America are now one country. The trifling distance
	of 3,000 miles across the Atlantic seems hardly worth counting,
	according to our modern notions; and the American gentleman
	talks quite easily and naturally about running over to London or
	Paris to see a series of dramatic performances or an exhibition of
	pictures. When Victoria began to reign the English people mostly
	regarded America as a dim region, and the voyage thither was a
	fearsome understanding.</p>

	<p>There is something in the catalogue of mechanical devices which
	almost affects the mind with fatigue. Fifty years ago the ordinary
	citizen picked up his ideas of all that was going on in the world
	from a sorely-taxed news-sheet; and a very blurred idea he managed
	to get at the best. Poor folk had to do without the luxury of the
	news, and they were as much circumscribed mentally as though
	they had been cattle; we remember a village where even in 1852 the
	common people did not know who the Duke of Wellington was.
	No such thing as a newspaper had been seen there within the
	memory of man; only one or two of the natives had seen a railway
	engine, and nobody in the whole village row had been known to
	visit a town. But now-a-days the villager has his high-class news-sheet;
	and he is very much discontented indeed if he does not see
	the latest intelligence from America, India, Australia, China—everywhere.
	An American statesman’s conversation of Monday afternoon
	is reported accurately in the London journals on Tuesday morning;
	a speech of Mr. Gladstone’s delivered at midnight on one day is
	summarized in New York and San Francisco the next day; the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18"> </a>result of a race run at Epsom is known in Bombay within forty
	minutes. We use no paradox when we say that every man in the
	civilized world now lives next door to everybody else; oceans are
	merely convenient pathways, howling deserts are merely handy
	places for planting telegraph poles and for swinging wires along
	which thoughts travel between country and country with the velocity
	of lightning. We see that the world with its swarming populations
	is growing more and more like some great organism whereof
	the nerve-centres are subtly, delicately connected by sensitive nerve-tissues.
	Even now, using a lady’s thimble, two pieces of metal, and
	a little acid, we can speak to a friend across the Atlantic gulf, and
	before ten years are over, a gentleman in London will doubtless be
	able to sit in his office and hear the actual tones of some speaker in
	New York.</p>

	<p>So much has the magic half century brought about.</p>

	<p>If we think of the scientific knowledge possessed by the most
	intelligent men when the Queen ascended the throne, we can hardly
	refrain from smiling, for it seems as though we were studying the
	mental endowment of a race of children. The science of electricity
	was in its infancy; the laws of force were misunderstood; men did
	not know what heat really was. They knew next to nothing of the
	history of the globe, and they accounted for the existence of varying
	species of plants and animals by means of the most infantine hypotheses.
	A complete revolution—vital and all-embracing—has
	altered our modes of thought, so that the man of 1887 can scarcely
	bring himself to conceive the state of mind which contented the
	man of 1837. We have dark doubts now, perplexing misgivings,
	weary uncertainties, painful consciousness of limited powers; but
	along with these weaknesses we have our share of certainties. Are
	we happier? Nay, not in mind. A quiet melancholy marks the
	words of all the men who have thought most deeply and learned
	most. The wise no longer cry out or complain—they accept life
	and fate with calm sadness, and perhaps with prayerful resignation.
	We have learned to know how little we can know, and we see with
	composure that even the miracles already achieved by the restless
	mind of man are as nothing.</p>

	<hr class="short" />

	<p>There is a far better reason than this for the sadness of thinking
	men. It is that, with all the progress of science, art, and education,
	poverty, misery, disease, and crime still afflict society as they did in
	ruder ages, and our progress is <em>onward</em>, but not <em>upward</em>. It is <em>upward</em>
	progress to which the <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> is devoted.</p>

	<p>In the foregoing sketch very little is said of the real progress of
	the age—the increase of education, the uprising of the people into
	greater political power and liberty, the prostration of the power of
	the church, which is destined to disestablishment, and the uprising
	of spiritual science.</p>

	<p>What is there in the reign of Victoria to be celebrated? Was
	there ever a more perfect specimen of barely respectable commonplace
	than the reign of Victoria? What generous impulse, or what
	<a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19"> </a>notable wisdom has she ever shown? What has she done for the
	relief of Ireland, for the improvement of a society full of pauperism,
	crime and suffering, or for the prevention of unjust foreign wars?
	When has she ever given even a respectable gift to any good object
	from her enormous income? But virtue is not expected in sovereigns;
	they are expected only to enjoy themselves hugely, to make an
	ostentatious display, and consume all their benighted subjects give
	them.</p>

	<p>Mrs. Stanton says:—“The two great questions now agitating
	Great Britain are ‘Coercion for Ireland,’ and the ‘Queen’s Jubilee,’
	a tragedy and a comedy in the same hour.”</p>

	<p>Speaking of the Queen’s Jubilee she says:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“In this supreme moment of the nation’s political crisis, the
		Queen and her suite are junketing around in their royal yachts on
		the coast of France, while proposing to celebrate her year of Jubilee
		by levying new taxes on her people, in the form of penny and pound
		contributions to build a monument to Prince Albert. The year of
		Jubilee! While under the eyes of the Queen her Irish subjects are
		being evicted from their holdings at the point of the bayonet; their
		cottages burned to the ground; aged and helpless men and women
		and newborn children, alike left crouching on the highways, under
		bridges, hayricks and hedges, crowded into poorhouses, jails and
		prisons, to expiate their crimes growing out of poverty on the one
		hand and patriotism on the other.</p>

		<p>“A far more fitting way to celebrate the year of Jubilee would be
		for the Queen to scatter the millions hoarded in her private vaults
		among her needy subjects, to mitigate, in some measure, the miseries
		they have endured from generation to generation; to inaugurate
		some grand improvement in her system of education; to extend still
		further the civil and political rights of her people; to suggest, perchance,
		an Inviolable Homestead Bill for Ireland, and to open the
		prison doors to her noble priests and patriots.</p>

		<p>“But instead of such worthy ambitions in the fiftieth year of her
		reign, what does the Queen propose? With her knowledge and
		consent, committees of ladies are formed in every county, town and
		village in all the colonies under her flag, to solicit these penny and
		pound contributions, to be placed at her disposal.</p>

		<p>“Ladies go from house to house, not only to the residences of the
		rich, but to the cottages of the poor, through all the marts of trade,
		the fields, the factories, begging pennies for the Queen from servants
		and day-laborers.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>These forced collections are not entirely for the benefit of the
	Queen, but are to be appropriated also to a vast variety of local
	objects and institutions.</p>

	<h2 class="title">The Outlook of Diogenes.</h2>

	<p>The ancient philosopher Diogenes, whom even the presence of
	Alexander could not overawe, is one of the most marked and heroic
	figures of ancient history. It is said “The Athenians admired his
	<a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20"> </a>contempt for comfort, and allowed him a wide latitude of comment
	and rebuke. Practical good was the chief aim of his philosophy;
	for literature and the fine arts he did not conceal his disdain. He
	laughed at men of letters for reading the sufferings of Ulysses
	while neglecting their own; at musicians who spent in stringing their
	lyres the time which would have been much better employed in
	making their own discordant natures harmonious; at savants for gazing
	at the heavenly bodies while sublimely incognizant of earthly ones;
	at orators who studied how to enforce truth, but not how to practice
	it. <em> </em> * When asked what business he was proficient in, he answered,
	‘to command men.’”</p>

	<p>Psychometry brings up these ancient characters as vividly and
	truthfully as history. Such psychometric descriptions are a continual
	miracle. How the psychometers, knowing not of whom they are
	speaking, guided only by a mysterious intuition, should speak of the
	most ancient characters as familiarly and truly as of our acquaintances
	to-day, will ever stand as a psychic miracle, to illustrate the
	Divine Wisdom that established such a power in man. This is the
	daily experience of Mrs. Buchanan. Her description of Diogenes
	was as follows:</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>“I think this is an ancient. There is something quaint about
		him. He does not seem to follow anything or anybody. He lived
		a natural life, indifferent to current teachings. He had peculiar
		original ideas of his own as to life and its purposes, and seems to be
		a man of philanthropic nature, not æsthetic, but very indifferent as
		to personal appearance and habits, or as to pleasing people, not at all
		fastidious. He did not mind people’s opinions in the least. They
		never disturbed him.</p>

		<p>“He had enough combativeness to fight his way through difficulties.
		He had great self-reliance, and did not mind obstacles. If he
		had to take part in disturbances, he was ready, and had tact and tactics.
		He had a peculiar power of governing men, and a peculiar
		way of gaining confidence and esteem. He did not show off at all,
		and was not at all condescending. He had a great deal of sagacity.
		He regarded as trifles things people considered as momentous.</p>

		<p>“(To what country did he belong?) He was probably a Greek,
		but he did not accord with anything of his time. He lived in the
		future and anticipated great changes. He did not agree with any
		contemporary religion, politics, fashions or manners, but was very
		sarcastic upon them. He was a philosopher, devoted to the useful,
		and cared nothing for the ornamental, either in architecture, fashions
		or anything else. He might not make war on the religion as he
		was not rancorous or rebellious, but he had different ideas in himself,
		and was candid in expressing them. He does not give much
		attention to modern times, but if he were here he would enjoy
		modern improvements and benevolence, but would denounce our
		fashions and our bigotry, and teach a primitive style of living.”</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>Let us invoke the strong spirit of Diogenes whose sturdy freedom
	of thought was like that of Walt Whitman, to coöperate in the review
	of modern life. Such men are greatly needed to review a
	<a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21"> </a>corrupt civilization; and where is the civilization now, where was
	there ever a civilization that was not corrupt? The function of
	Diogenes is not performed either by the pulpit or the press. A
	few special journals are terribly severe on special evils, but the
	reformatory words of the press generally are few and far between, in
	comparison to what is needed. The <cite class="name">Journal of Man</cite> does not
	propose to fill the hiatus and make war upon the myriad evils of
	society, but it must speak out, now and then, like Diogenes, especially
	when others neglect their duty.</p>

	<p>What is the condition of our legislative bodies? Where is there
	one that does not provoke sharp criticism? The Albany correspondent
	of the <cite>N. Y. Sun</cite>, speaking of the legislative adjournment, says;
	“Mr. William F. Sheehan, leader of the Democratic minority to the
	Assembly, summed up the work of the Legislature of 1887 when in
	his address on the floor of the Assembly on the day of final adjournment,
	he said: ‘Prayer will ascend from thousands of hearts of the
	citizens of this State at noon to-day for their deliverance from this
	Legislature. It began its session with the corrupt election of a
	United States Senator. It lived in bribery, and it dies a farce.’
	No one here regrets the adjournment except the gamblers and the
	lobbyists. Even the lobbyists would be glad for a vacation, as their
	labors in bidding for the legislative cattle the last month have been
	most arduous. The people of Albany look on the Legislature as a
	pestilence to which they must yearly submit, and they welcome its
	departure as a farmer does the going of a swarm of locusts from his
	fields.</p>

	<p>“Whatever else may be said about the Legislature of 1887, no one
	ever accused it of being honest, and there is no doubt that it was
	industrious.”</p>

	<p>This corrupt Legislature passed two very discreditable bills which
	would have been made positively infamous if it had not been for the
	active opposition of a few friends of liberty. One of these bills
	was designed to add to the stringency of the present obstructive
	medical law; the other was designed to assist the labors of Anthony
	Comstock in interrupting the circulation of popular physiological
	literature, under pretence of suppressing obscenity.</p>

	<p>In the Legislature of Pennsylvania, the law designed to suppress
	the cultivation of spiritual science by severe penalties, was favorably
	reported by a committee but prevented by popular indignation from
	passing. Yet the people were not sufficiently alert to prevent legislation
	in favor of that monopoly the Standard Oil Company, which
	is considered a betrayal of justice.</p>

	<p>In Illinois a bill was passed in the Senate and came near passing
	in the House, which would have abolished all medical freedom and
	made it a crime for any one but a licensed doctor to help the sick in
	any way, even by a prayer. Verily the spirit of American liberty
	does not pervade American communities and American legislatures.</p>

	<p>In Massachusetts the Old Puritanic Sunday Laws having fallen
	into “<em>innocuous desuetude</em>,” an attempt to give them a partial enforcement
	in Boston compelled a little legislative action and the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22"> </a>result was what might have been expected in a State in which religious
	opinions are allowed to interfere with the credibility of a witness,
	and in which Diogenes, if he were here, would be struck with the
	vast inconsistency between the creed of Christendom and its practice,
	and the vast disparity between the progress of modern knowledge
	and the effete system of education in our Universities. He
	would wonder why modern colleges are more interested in the details
	of Greek life and letters than in the beneficent sciences of
	to-day of which the Greeks knew nothing.</p>

	<p>He would wonder why the edicts of the Pagan emperor, Constantine,
	concerning the observance of Sunday are observed and enforced
	as a religious duty, while the Divine love inculcated by Jesus Christ,
	which forbids all strife and war, is no more regarded by Christian
	nations than by the rulers of ancient Rome.</p>

	<p>He would look into the schools and universities professedly devoted
	to science and literature, and ask why they have even less freedom
	of discussion and thought than the schools of Athens, every
	professor being interested to discourage the investigation of novelties
	in philosophy instead of being ready to welcome original investigation.</p>

	<p>Under the new Sunday law of Massachusetts, Sunday trains and
	steamboat lines are at the mercy of the railroad commissioners, who
	can stop every one of them; but boating, yachting, and carriage
	driving on Sunday are free to all who have the money to pay for
	them. But while outdoor frolic is free-and-easy, indoor enjoyment
	is prohibited. Everybody is liable to five dollar fines for <em>attending</em>
	“any sport, game, or play” on Sunday, unless it has been licensed,
	and private families never ask a license for their own amusements.
	But <em>to be present</em> on Sunday “<em>at any dancing</em>,” brings a liability to a
	$50 fine for each offence! What a terrible thing dancing is to be
	sure, that looking on should cost $50, while a frolic in boating and
	yachting is unexceptionably holy, and the fast young men may kick
	up a dust, kill the horses, and smash the buggies with impunity, or
	kill themselves by rowing in the hot sun, under whiskey stimulus on
	Sunday.</p>

	<p>The laws for hotels and restaurants are even more absurd.
	Travellers, strangers and lodgers may be freely entertained, but if
	<em>anybody else</em> (who is he?) comes into the house, or remains on the
	grounds about it, on Sunday, the landlord can be fined as much as
	$50 at the first pop, $100 at the second pop, and at the third pop he
	is to be shut up and deprived of his license. Somebody else must
	be a terrible fellow on Sunday—and he is a dangerous customer
	on Saturday too, for if he comes in on Saturday evening, or even
	lounges on the grounds, it is a fine of five dollars for the landlord.
	But who is he? How is the poor landlord, or victualler to discover
	<em>somebody else</em>, who is neither lodger, stranger, nor traveller. The
	landlord cannot detect him, but all sheriffs, grand jurors, and
	constables are required to hunt for him!  <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive la bagatelle!</em></p>

	<p>Strictly private gambling is safe on Sunday, and our <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chevaliers
	d’Industrie</em> may ruin a dozen families, and provoke suicide and murder,—“plate
	sin with gold” and it is protected, and the swindling
	<a class="pagenum" id="page23" title="23"> </a>shyster is protected too on Sunday, for no civil process can be served
	on that holy day; the rogue who is bothered on that day can get
	exemplary damages by this law of Sunday asylum. But the poor
	keeper of a restaurant or of an inn, is the victim for old legislative
	boys to throw stones at. They have provided a hundred dollar fine
	for every innholder or victualler who keeps, or “suffers to be kept,” on
	his premises, any implements “used in gaming,” or which may be used
	for “purposes of amusement,” and does not prevent such things from
	being used on Sunday. So if he is not extremely vigilant throughout
	his house and grounds, he may be caught with a hundred dollar fine,
	OR be imprisoned three months in the House of Correction at the
	pleasure of the magistrate!! and for every subsequent offense may be
	<em>imprisoned in the House of Correction</em> as much as one year, and then
	required to give security for obeying the law. Under such a law a
	malicious young hoodlum may contrive to send a landlord to jail.</p>

	<p>To open a shop, warehouse, or workhouse on Sunday is a fifty
	dollar offense, and it is fifty dollars also for doing “any manner of
	labor, business or work” on Sunday, unless the judge considers it a
	matter of necessity or charity; nevertheless, the “making of butter
	and cheese” is good Sunday work, if we do not <em>open the doors</em> which
	would bring on a $50 fine. So is the work of steam, gas and electricity,
	newspapers, telegraphs, telephones, druggists, milkmen, (bakers
	before 10 and after 4,) boat houses, livery stables, ferry boats,
	and street cars. But to catch a fish or fire a pistol on Sunday is a
	$10 offense, and to look on at a game of chess is a $50 crime.
	However, the law does not punish whistling on Sunday, unless the
	whistler has spectators, then it is a $50 business for all concerned.
	To read Longfellow’s Excelsior on Sunday to a parlor of
	company is a $50 crime. Reading Milton’s Paradise Lost, or the
	American Declaration of Independence would also rank as criminal
	business, being an entertainment, and a party of twenty playing a
	game of croquet may be fined a thousand dollars.</p>

	<p>Verily, if it were not for such hypocritical and asinine legislation
	as this, we might forget the history of New England witchcraft, and
	the hanging of Quakers in sight of the spot where this law was
	enacted as an <em>improvement</em> on a still worse, but practically obsolete
	statute.</p>

	<p>Such Sunday legislation is a fair evidence of the absence of true
	religion, and the predominance of hypocrisy. It is not enforced,
	and is not expected to be. All the Sunday legislation in New York
	did not prevent the immense Syracuse Salt Works from carrying on
	their work day and night. Gov. Hill and the N. Y. Legislature have
	shown their character by increasing the penalties of the Sunday laws,
	but they have not approached the Massachusetts standard.</p>

	<h2 class="title">A Bill to Destroy the Indians.</h2>

	<p class="author">From the Boston Pilot.</p>

	<p>The Puritans of New England and the Cavaliers of Virginia alike
	treated the Indians as though they had no rights of manhood. The
	Catholics, Baptists, and Quakers treated them kindly and justly.
	<a class="pagenum" id="page24" title="24"> </a>The Puritans took Indian lands without permission or compensation.
	The Catholics, Baptists and Quakers bought lands from the Indians in
	an honorable way.</p>

	<p>The two policies have been in conflict for nearly three centuries.</p>

	<p>The Government has held to the policy of buying lands from the
	Indians, thus recognizing their ownership; but it has not always
	paid the price agreed upon. Now, under the lead of Senator Dawes
	Congress has passed a bill which annuls the treaties, and overrides
	all proprietary rights of every tribe, except nine of the most civilized.</p>

	<p>His bill is the “Indian Land in Severalty Bill.” It pretends to be
	in the interest of the Indians, but that pretense is a fraud. It is
	wholly in the interest of railroad companies, land syndicates, and
	private white settlers.</p>

	<p>The treaties of 1868 and 1876 guarantee the Sioux tribes undisturbed
	possession of their reservation in Dakota. Not an acre of that
	land can be taken from them without the consent of three-fourths of
	them. So read the treaties signed by the United States Commissioners
	and confirmed by the United States Senate.</p>

	<p>The Dawes Severalty Bill takes the Sioux reservation from the
	control of the Sioux without asking the consent of a single Indian,
	surveys it as though it was a body of public land, and then says to
	the Sioux: The Government will return a small homestead for each
	of you, as individuals, and after twenty-five years you shall have
	titles to these small tracts, but the remainder of the reservation,
	(about four-fifth) must be opened to white settlers.</p>

	<p>The Sioux protest against this outrage, and have appealed to the
	National Indian Defence Association at Washington, D. C., to
	protect their rights. This association has resolved to test the constitutionality
	of this bill in the Supreme Court of the United States,
	and asks all friends of justice to sustain them in this legal contest.</p>

		medical profession has taken up the science in earnest, and re-named it hypnotism.
		The Seybert report will not even be a temporary damper, for

		familiar with the facts, the commission has done nothing but to emphasize
		the fact already familiar among the intelligent, of the prevalence of
		fraud among mediums. Notwithstanding the wonderful powers of Slade,
		no one acquainted with his history would place any reliance on his integrity.
		The more intelligent Spiritualists understood such matters, and the Ladies’
		Aid (Spiritualist) Society of Boston, recently had considerable amusement
		in the exhibition in their parlors of the materializing and dematerializing
		wire apparatus used by the fraudulent medium, Mrs. Ross, which
		was said to have been carried in her bustle. Mrs. Ross when prosecuted for
		<a class="pagenum" id="page25" title="25"> </a>her frauds was found to be protected by the law of coverture which makes the
		husband alone responsible. This is a relic of the idea of female subordination
		and obedience which ought to be abolished. The progress of spiritualism
		has been marked by as many follies as that of any popular movement, and
		the bequest of $60,000, by Mr. Seybert, to the old fogies of the Pennsylvania
		University was among the stupidest of these follies. If a friend of Galileo
		had made such a bequest to the Catholic church in his time, to get an opinion
		of the new astronomy, it would have been as sensible a proceeding. It
		will however have one good result; it will erect a permanent monument to
		the ignorance of the universities, a record from which they cannot hereafter
		escape. Prof. Leidy was one of the salaried commissioners whose mental
		status was thus exhibited in the last journal:</p>

	<p>The reader now understands the conformation of the brain, and
	the general character of its different regions. It is important that
	he should as soon as possible begin the study of heads, and learn to
	judge correctly their development. When he can do this, he has an
	inexhaustible source of knowledge continually with him, and every
	new acquaintance becomes an interesting study in ascertaining the
	indications of his head and comparing them with his daily conduct
	and manners.  The more thorough and careful the study, the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27"> </a>greater the satisfaction and delight that it yields. The good cranioscopist
	continually grows in knowledge, and solves all the problems
	of character presented in society. But he who simply studies the
	elements of character or organic faculties, and does not become
	acquainted with the organs and their measurement, soon finds his
	knowledge too abstract and remote from his daily life; and, instead
	of increasing his stock of knowledge on this subject, he continually
	loses more and more of what he has gained. It was for this reason,
	mainly, that the medical profession gradually dropped the discoveries
	of Gall, which would never have ceased to interest them if they
	had learned to apply them to the study of men and animals.</p>

	<p>I hope that no reader will neglect this chapter, or fail to reduce
	its instructions to practice, for on that it depends whether he shall
	become a practical master of cerebral science, and be able to read
	every character with which he meets.</p>

	<p>The first step in studying a head is to observe its general contour,—whether
	the forehead projects far in front of the ear, to indicate
	intellect; whether the upper surface rises above the forehead
	sufficiently to indicate the nobler qualities, and whether it is
	balanced or overpowered by the breadth and depth of the base of
	the skull and thickness of the neck. In connection with this, we
	may observe that the base of the brain is also expressed in the lower
	part of the face which corresponds to the organs for the expression
	of animal force, while the upper part of the face is devoted to the
	expression of the upper and anterior parts of the brain. The
	expressional faculties shown in the face do not always coincide
	exactly with the real power of the organs thus expressed; but if they
	do not, they at least indicate their activity and habitual display; for
	faculties habitually indulged will show their organic indications in
	the face, while those which are suppressed or restrained will be less
	conspicuous in the face.</p>

	<p>The reader will understand that organs located for observation on
	the face are organs of the brain lying behind the face, which may be
	reached and stimulated through it, as other organs are reached and
	stimulated through the cranium and integuments. The contour of
	the face cannot reveal the organs behind it by physical necessity, as
	does the contour of the skull, yet observation induces me to rely
	upon estimates based on facial development. I think there is a
	correspondence of development between the brain and face, based
	upon vital laws, and also a direct influence of each organ upon the
	surface that covers it, so that when the organ is excited the surface
	becomes flushed, and when it is kept inactive the surface becomes
	pale and withered. This may be most readily observed at the
	organ of Love of Stimulus, immediately in front of the cavity of the
	ear. The surface presents a shrunken appearance after many years
	of rigid abstinence, but becomes plump, bloated, or high-colored, in
	those whose habits are intemperate. I have also observed an itching
	sensation at the surface when the organs behind it were active.
	Any one may observe a warmth and fulness in the upper part of the
	face when the social sentiments are very active. In the act of
	<a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28"> </a>blushing, the flush comes upon the part of the face associated with
	modest and refined sentiments, the centre of which is below the
	external angle of the eye, at the lower margin of the cheek-bone.</p>

	<p>The contrasting development of the upper and lower parts of the
	face may be seen when we compare such characters as the enthusiastic
	philanthropist and educational reformer, Pestalozzi, and the high-principled
	and intellectual Hugh Miller, the Scotch geologist, with
	such as Danton, the terrible demagogue of the French revolution,
	and Mirabeau, the brilliant but unprincipled orator.</p>

	<p>No skilful artist in caricature fails to observe these principles.
	When he would degrade a character, he magnifies the lower part of
	the face; and when he would represent a more refined character,
	the lower part of the face becomes correspondingly delicate.</p>

	<p>When <cite>Puck</cite> would represent, a miserable wretch, he presents such
	a head as the following; and when a New York journalist desired
	to caricature an opponent as a saloon politician, he diminished the
	upper and developed the lower part of the head, as presented here.</p>

	</div>

	<p>All observers of countenance and character unconsciously act
	upon these principles and recognize a great difference in the expressions
	of two faces,—one predominant in the lower and the other in
	the upper portion of the face. That there was any scientific basis
	for this was entirely unknown before my discoveries of the organs
	behind the face, which modify its development and expression. My
	lectures upon this subject in 1842 were attended by the physiognomical
	writer, Redfield, who derived from them many important suggestions.</p>

	<p>When the lower part of the face is massive, broad, and prominent,
	while the basilar region is broad and deep, with a stout neck, we
	know the great force and activity of the animal nature, and unless
	the upper surface of the brain is well developed all over, we may
	expect some excess in the way of violence, temper, selfishness,
	perversity, sensuality, dishonesty, avarice, rudeness of manners, moral
	insensibility, slander, contentiousness, jealousy, envy, revenge, or
	some other form of wickedness, according to the especial conformation.</p>

	<p><a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29"> </a>In the faces of women, we find the activity of the amiable sentiments
	marked by the fulness and roseate color of the upper part of
	the face, while the lower portion is more delicate than in the masculine
	face.</p>

	<p>But although the facial developments generally correspond with
	the activity of the organs expressed, the rule is not invariable, as
	the reader will learn hereafter that the facial developments may be
	moderate when the character is not excitable or demonstrative.</p>

	<p>If the upper surface of the head is sufficiently high, we know that
	great capacity for virtue exists, capable of restraining evil inclinations,
	and producing admirable traits of character, according to the
	organs especially developed.</p>

	<p>When we study the special organs we determine the special
	virtues or vices. For example, a head may have a good general
	development upward, giving many very pleasing traits of character,
	and yet be so deficient in the region of conscientiousness (while the
	selfish group that gives breadth at the ears is large) as to produce
	great moral unsoundness and a treacherous violation of obligations
	or disregard of principle.</p>

	<p>The most delicate task in craniological study, and the most important,
	is the balancing of opposite tendencies belonging to antagonistic
	organs; and it was for the want of the knowledge of antagonisms
	that the Gallian system so often failed in describing character
	and its representatives before the public have made the most
	disastrous blunders. Shrewd and honest observers discovered the
	imperfections of the science.<a href="#footnote_2" id="fnm2" title="A letter just received..." class="fnmarker">2</a></p>

	<p>While the eye readily gives us the contour of heads that have
	not much hair, there is but little accurate judgment without the use
	of the hand, which is the first thing to be learned. Not the tips of
	the fingers, but the whole hand should be laid upon the head gently,
	to cover as much surface as possible, while with a gentle pressure
	we cause the scalp to move slightly, and thus feel through it the
	exact form of the cranium as correctly as if the bones were exposed
	to view. If in this examination we find any sharp prominences,
	which might be called bumps, we attribute them to the growth of
	bone, which does not indicate the growth of the brain. The latter
	is indicated only by the general contour.</p>

	<p>A little anatomical knowledge will prevent us from being deceived,
	and enable us to make due allowances. There are no great difficulties
	in making a correct estimate, and the anatomists who have
	taught their pupils that correct cranial observations could not be
	made, only showed their own ignorance of the subject. We must
	consider the cranium as though all osseous protuberances had been
	shaved off, leaving the smooth, curving contour of the skull. The
	principal projection to be removed is the superciliary ridge corresponding
	to the brow at the base of the forehead.  It is formed by
	<a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30"> </a>the projection of the external plate of the skull, leaving a separation
	or cavity between it and the inner plate, which cavity is called
	the frontal sinus, and is sometimes half an inch wide. As there is
	no positive method of determining its dimensions in the living head,
	there must ever be some doubt concerning the development of the
	perceptive organs which it covers. The superciliary ridge at the
	external angle of the brow extends really as much as three-quarters
	of an inch from the brain. From this angle a ridge of bone (the
	temporal arch) extends upward and backward, separating the
	lateral surface of the head from the frontal and upper surfaces.
	This ridge is a convenient landmark, but must be excluded from an
	estimate of development as it is merely osseous. It extends back
	on the head a little behind its middle. The sagittal suture on the
	median line of the upper surface usually presents a slight, bony
	elevation or ridge (see the engraving of the skull, Chapter III.), and
	the lambdoid suture on the back of the head is frequently rough.
	A superficial practical phrenologist (of great pretensions) at Cincinnati,
	in examining the head of a gentleman of mild character, found
	the lambdoid suture quite rough, and gave him a terrifically pugnacious
	character, not knowing enough to distinguish between osseous
	and cerebral development. The occipital knob on the median line
	between the cerebrum and cerebellum, has been already mentioned.
	The mastoid process, the bony prominence behind the ear is a projection
	exterior to the cerebellum. Where it starts from the cranium
	above and behind the cavity of the ear, we may judge of basilar
	development by the breadth of the head, but the basilar depth
	which is more important is to be judged by the extension downward,
	which was illustrated in the last chapter by comparing the skulls of
	J. R. Smith and the slave-trading count.</p>

	<p>To judge the comparative strength of the higher and lower elements
	of character, we look for the height above the forehead and
	the depth at and behind the ear, which is ascertained by placing the
	hand on the base of the cranium behind the ears, while the height
	of the head is best appreciated by placing a hand on the top with
	the fingers reaching down to the brow.</p>

	<p>In a profile view the human head may be divided into three equal
	parts, the length of the nose being the central part, from the nose to
	the end of the chin another, and the remainder above the nose the
	third part. In inferior heads these three measurements are
	equal, the upper third extending to the top of the head; but in
	heads of superior character the upper third extends only to the top
	of the forehead, and the outline of the head rises a half breadth
	above the forehead, as the following profiles show. In heads of
	the lowest character the basilar depth exceeds the height, as in the
	French Count and the Indian Lewis.</p>

	<p>The contour of a well-developed head forms a semicircle above
	the base line through the brow, and its elevation above that line is
	equal to one half of the antero-posterior length of the head, while in
	the inferior class of heads the elevation is but four-tenths of the
	length or even less, and is hardly equal to the depth, while in the
	<a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31"> </a>highest class the elevation is one-half greater than the depth or even
	more. We obtain another view of the comparative height and
	depth by drawing lines from the brow to the vertex and the base of
	the brain and comparing the two angles thus formed. In the good
	head we observe the great superiority of the upper angle over that
	formed by the line to the ear, the lower end of which corresponds
	to the lowest part of the brain, the base of the cerebellum.</p>

	<div id="figure-3" class="image">
		<a href="images/fig3.png"><img src="images/fig3-th.png" width="674" height="314" alt="Profile views of two heads, with horizontal lines as described above." /></a>
	</div>

	<p>To take an illustration from nature, I would present the outlines
	of two Indian crania that I obtained in Florida,—Vacca Pechassee,
	or the cow chief, who headed a small tribe, and bore a good character
	among the whites, and Lewis, an Indian of bad character in the same
	neighborhood (on the Appalachicola River), who was shot for his
	crimes. (I might have obtained many more, but as the Seminole
	war was not then over, I found that my own cranium was placed in
	considerable danger by my explorations.)</p>

	<div id="figure-4" class="image">
		<a href="images/fig4.png"><img src="images/fig4-th.png" width="652" height="312" alt="Two skulls in profile. Left is Vacca Pechassee, right is Lewis." /></a>
	</div>

	<p>In Vacca Pechassee the height is to the depth as 11 to 9; in Lewis
	as 9 to 11. In J. R. Smith the height is to the depth as 12 to 10; in
	the slave trading count as 9 to 14. This is the correct method
	of cranial study, for comparing the moral and animal nature.</p>

	<p>The basilar depth was entirely overlooked in the old method of
	phrenologists, and hence they were very often mistaken in judging
	<a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32"> </a>the basilar energy by breadth alone, of which there has been no
	more striking example than that of the Thugs of India, whose heads
	(though a tribe of murderers) were below the European average in
	basilar breadth. These facts are so conspicuous to any careful
	observer that I became very familiar with them in the first six
	months of my study of heads fifty-two years ago.</p>

	<p>When the circulation of the brain is vigorous and regular, all
	portions being in regular activity, the fulness of the circulation being
	shown in the face, we may be sure that the character is fairly
	indicated by the cranium. The younger the individual the thinner
	the cranium, and the less the liability to deception by the thickness
	of the bones. Female skulls are <em>generally</em> more delicate than male,
	and also more normal or uniform in their circulation. Hence there
	is less difficulty in making an accurate estimate of women and of
	youth. The greater difficulty is found in men of thick skulls and
	abnormal brains, and these difficulties are in some cases insurmountable
	by mere measurement. It will become necessary in the depraved
	classes to look at the condition of the circulation about the
	head, and the facial indications of the organs that have been cultivated.
	If these are not sufficient to guide us we must fall back upon
	psychometry.</p>

	<p>The morbid condition of the brain is a conspicuous fact, which
	we must not ignore, and it is important to learn how to
	detect it in the appearance of the individual, or in his psychometric
	indications and Pathognomy, which is itself a profound
	science and important guide to character. (Pathognomy is the
	science of expression, and has an exact mathematical basis.)</p>

	<p>We should bear in mind that it is just as possible to have impaired
	and unhealthy conditions in any part of the brain as to have them in
	the stomach, liver, lungs, or spinal cord. Physical diseases are contagious
	and so are moral. It is generally impossible to preserve the
	moral organs and faculties of a youth in healthy condition who is
	allowed to associate habitually with the depraved; and it is very
	difficult indeed for the mature adult to preserve his brain and mind
	in sound condition when compelled to associate with the depraved.
	To those who are very impressible, the contagion of vice, bad temper,
	profanity, turbulence, lying, obscenity, sullenness, melancholy,
	etc., is as inevitable as the contagion of small pox.</p>

	<p>Our criminals are generally exposed to the contagion of crime in
	youth, and as they advance they are immersed in this contagion
	in prisons, which are the moral pest-houses in which law maintains
	the intense contagion of criminal depravity. Napoleon was an admirable
	subject for such contamination, and when we learn how he
	was reared amid the lawlessness and general scoundrelism of Corsica,
	we do not wonder that he became an imperial brigand. The low
	ethical standard of mankind, generally, and especially of historians,
	has heretofore prevented a just estimate of the character of Napoleon.
	Royal criminals have escaped condemnation; but the recent
	review of Napoleon’s career by Taine gives a just philosophic estimate
	of the man, which coincides with the impartial estimation
	of psychometry.</p>

	<div class="ad_narrow">
		<p>The establishment of a new Journal is a hazardous
		and expensive undertaking. Every reader of
		this volume receives what has cost more than he
		pays for it, and in addition receives the product of
		months of editorial, and many years of scientific,
		labor. May I not therefore ask his aid in relieving
		me of this burden by increasing the circulation of
		the Journal among his friends?</p>

		<p>The establishment of the Journal was a duty.
		There was no other way effectively to reach the
		people with its new sphere of knowledge. Buckle
		has well said in his “History of Civilization,” that
		“No great political improvement, no great reform,
		either legislative or executive, has ever been originated
		in any country by its ruling class. The first
		suggestors of each steps have invariably been bold
		and able thinkers, who discern the abuse, denounce
		it, and point out the remedy.”</p>

		<p>This is equally true in science, philanthropy, and
		religion. When the advance of knowledge and
		enlightenment of conscience render reform or revolution
		necessary, the ruling powers of college,
		church, government, capital, and the press, present
		a solid combined resistance which the teachers of
		novel truth cannot overcome without an appeal to
		the people. The grandly revolutionary science of
		Anthropology, which offers in one department (Psychometry)
		“the dawn of a new civilization,” and
		in other departments an entire revolution in social,
		ethical, educational, and medical philosophy, has
		experienced the same fate as all other great scientific
		and philanthropic innovations, in being compelled
		to sustain itself against the mountain mass
		of established error by the power of truth alone.
		The investigator whose life is devoted to the evolution
		of the truth cannot become its propagandist.
		A whole century would be necessary to the full
		development of these sciences to which I can give but
		a portion of one life. Upon those to whom these
		truths are given, who can intuitively perceive their
		value, rests the task of sustaining and diffusing the
		truth.</p>

		<p>The circulation of the Journal is necessarily
		limited to the sphere of liberal minds and advanced
		thinkers, but among these it has had a more warm
		and enthusiastic reception than was ever before
		given to any periodical. There must be in the
		United States twenty or thirty thousand of the
		class who would warmly appreciate the Journal,
		but they are scattered so widely it will be years
		before half of them can be reached without the
		active co-operation of my readers, which I most
		earnestly request.</p>

		<p>Prospectuses and specimen numbers will be furnished
		to those who will use them, and those who
		have liberal friends not in their own vicinity may
		confer a favor by sending their names that a prospectus
		or specimen may be sent them. A liberal
		commission will be allowed to those who canvass for
		subscribers.</p>

		<div class="subsection">
			<h3>Enlargement of the Journal.</h3>

			<p>The requests of readers for the enlargement of
			the Journal are already coming in. It is a great
			disappointment to the editor to be compelled each
			month to exclude so much of interesting matter, important
			to human welfare, which would be gratifying
			to its readers. The second volume therefore
			will be enlarged to 64 pages at $2 per
			annum.</p>

		<h3>COLLEGE OF THERAPEUTICS.</h3>

		<p>The eighth session is now in progress with an

		November. I do not approve of medical legislation,
		but if it could be considered just to prohibit
		medical practice without a college education, it
		would be much more just to prohibit magnetic and
		electric practice without such practical instruction
		as is given in the College of Therapeutics and at

		<h3>UNLIKE ANY OTHER PAPER.</h3>

		<p>The <cite>Spectator</cite>, unlike other home papers, seeks
		(1) to acquaint every family with simple and efficient
		treatment for the various common diseases,
		to, in a word, educate the people so they can avoid
		disease and cure sickness, thus saving enormous
		doctors’ bills, and many precious lives. (2) To
		elevate and cultivate the moral nature, awakening
		the conscience, and developing the noblest attributes
		of manhood. (3) To give instructive and
		entertaining food to literary taste, thus developing
		the mind. (4) To give just such hints to housekeepers
		that they need to tell how to prepare
		delicious dishes, to beautify homes, and to make
		the fireside the most attractive spot in the world.</p>

		<p>Write for terms for agents, and go to work. We
		give liberal commission to those who will canvas
		for the <cite>Spectator</cite>, and the paper so commends itself
		to the people it is not difficult to secure subscribers.</p>

		<p>The young ladies among our subscribers will take
		much delight in the clear and practical article on
		how to secure and retain beauty. The formulas
		are the best, and instead of being injurious are
		beneficial, in cases where they are indicated. We
		feel sure the article will be highly prized, and prove
		of great value.</p>

		each month.</p>

		<p>All communications should be addressed to the

		in midwifery and all cases of nervous prostration.
